# find-that-file
`find-that-file` is a GUI ~~Graphical User Interface~~
Game User Interface file explorer that requires you to control
a character in order to navigate your file system's files and directories.
When your character collides with a directory, you enter that directory.
When your character collides with a file, that file is opened in your
default program.

The project is built using `pygame` since python has excellent libraries
such as `pathlib` for dealing with paths

**This project is meant mostly as a joke**
